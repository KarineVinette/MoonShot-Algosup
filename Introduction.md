## What
When you want to build a ring, you want to see how it fit you. With a ring-try-on in augmented reality, you can see with your phone how it fit on your hand.

## Why
Augmented reality is in development nowadays, so it can be interesting to participate in developing this technique in a field where you need to try fake objects in the real world.

## How
To solve that problem, I want to use machine learning with openCV or TensorFlow, and Vuforia or AR Fondation for the augmented reality part.
It will be an unity application.
